    "The model, given it's current parameters, is able to predict an athlete that is most likely to win gold based on the given columns with about 50-60% accuracy. A limitation of this implementation is that it is very computationally intensive. To get a result of 80% or higher, which would be ideal in, would require a lot of computational power to increase the number of iterations. The implemenation of the gaussian mechanism just before training the model ensures differential privacy of the output by adding noise to the entire dataset thus ensuring that the model could not memorize the dataset given to it."
